# Final Project
This API is a greenhouse gas (**GHG**) emission factor display API that returns data about the emission factors generated by various industries. 

This API is for the envrionmentally conscious individuals and researchers looking for figures for GHG emissions.

This API is still currently under development.

## Dataset Used
This API uses the [**Supply Chain Greenhouse Gas Emission Factors v1.2 by NAICS-6**](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/supply-chain-greenhouse-gas-emission-factors-v1-2-by-naics-6) for the emission data. 

## Deploying the API
Requirements: 
- MiniKube or a Kubernetes cloud
- At least Python 3.9+
- Docker

To download this API, clone this repository to the local device. After that, follow the instructions below.
1. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory containing the project files.
2. Run `make` in the terminal.

The cluster should be up and running. Run `kubectl get services` to confirm that `ghg-redis-server ` and `ghg-analysis-api` have been created.

## Using the API
Follow these instructions below to run the API:
1. In your terminal, run `kubectl get services` to find the external IP address of your project.
2. Navigate to the browser.
3. Enter the corresponding IP and port number in the format `http://<ip address>:<port number>/<endpoint>`

Below are the endpoints the API provides:
| Endpoint | Description |
| - | - |
| /graph-industry | Gets aggregate emission factor data of specific industry/industries. Has optional data option that allows the specification of certain industries. |
| /graph-gas  | Gets individual emission factors of specific industry/industries |
| /create-aggregate | Creates an aggregate data point | 
| /create-gas | Creates a gas data point |
| /list-gas | Get a list of all unique GHG names available for querying |
| /delete-<code> | Delete based on NAICS code |
| /update | Update based on element based on NAICS code |
